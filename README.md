Quick demonstration of OOP concepts for a student

This was developed to show a student with constraints (could only use conditional logic and loops) how one could potentially implement the same assignment without constraints.
Demonstrates usage of the static keyword, OOP, etc.

TODO: Main thing to do is add input validation. This is currently tasked to the student.
